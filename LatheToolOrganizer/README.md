# Lathe tool organizer

Organizer for 0XA-sized tool holders, meant to go inside a drawer underneath the lathe. Spare bits could conceivably go underneath the rack to keep things a smidge tidier.

Intended to be laser-cut from 1/8" acrylic sheet; layout.svg arranges the key parts to fit on a single 12"x12" sheet and includes an engraving layer (red) as well as the cuts (black). 3d assembly as .stl and individual parts' .dxf provided as well.
